=========

A Plone site has many translation domains available.  By default,
they're all global, but they can be overridden, so to allow through
the web customization of translations by the user.

By default, we have 'plonelocales' translation domain.  Let's try and
look up 'April' in Danish:

  >>> from zope import component
  >>> from zope.i18n.interfaces import ITranslationDomain
  >>> domain = component.getUtility(ITranslationDomain, name='plonelocales')
  >>> domain.translate(u'month_apr', target_language='da')
  u'april'
